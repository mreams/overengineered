Based on the SpringBoot REST webservice example app, see https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-rest-service

== What's here

A ridiculously overengineered example app. Why? Because overengineering is funny as long as you do it on purpose :)

The endpoints are 
----
http://localhost:8080/greeting
http://localhost:8080/farewell
----
They both have two optional params, `name` and `language`

The app can be run with 
----
./gradlew bootRun
----
from the Complete directory. The project has been left in the Complete directory to make it easier to diff it with the original example code at https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-rest-service.

== What's missing

No database, no authentication, no rate limiting, no way to add or remove greetings/farewells.
